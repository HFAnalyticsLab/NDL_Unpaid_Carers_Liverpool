# Networked Data Lab: NDL Liverpool and Wirral analysis on Children and Young People's Mental Health in Liverpool and Wirral

#### Project Status: In-progress

## Project Description

This Networked Data Lab analysis by the NDL lab in Liverpool and Wirral focusses on the demographics, health and access to support of unpaid carers in Liverpool and Wirral. 

Please note that these research outputs have not yet been peer-reviewed and should be treated as preliminary.

## Research questions

This study has responded to a set of research questions, which might help to improve our understanding of carers’ needs and contexts:

- How many adults are registered with GP or social services as a carer?
- Have these changed over time?
- How likely are people to become a carer based on gender, ethnicity, age, or deprivation?
- Do carers tend be concentrated in certain areas?
- What delays in receiving support to carers face?
- What health issues do carers deal with?
